			<p>Pigs are very delicous and every part of their body can be used. It is a very fatty protein, so make sure to excercise alot if you don't want your stomache to grow big. Many owners feed their pig to the point of being obese just to extract more meat from them. This process can be very cruel and unhealthy.</p>
